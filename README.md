# Important Notice
This is no longer being worked on and will not receive fixes/updates.
If you are forking this repository, do not share your ROBLOSECURITY cookie! Doing so allows others to access your account!

- Easy setup

## FAQ

#### Why doesn't it work?

Check the .env file and make sure everything is correct.

#### I keep getting rate limited!

The roblox API only allows 5 ally requests from a cookie per hour.

#### How do I get a cookie?

To do this, you must have a PC. Open any browser of your choice and open the developer tools or inspect element. Go to the application tab and then cookies. Find the cookie named .ROBLOSECURITY and copy the value. This doesn't save/send your cookie anywhere.
